# Apprentice of the Force

## Description

"Apprentice of the Force" is a project developed by the "The Troopers" team during their training days. This project is
intended to be a practical exercise to learn and reinforce programming concepts while delving into the exciting world of
Star Wars.

Throughout the project, developers will tackle challenges related to game mechanics, including turn-based combat, damage
calculation, and decision-making logic. Implementing features like character selection, weapon and special move
selection, and battle outcomes will provide hands-on experience in problem-solving and algorithm development.

The project will act as a sandbox for developers to experiment with different programming techniques, architectural
decisions and design patterns. Also it will be a great opportunity to experiment with new technologies and tools.
